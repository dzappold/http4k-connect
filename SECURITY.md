# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please reach out to: `security@http4k.org` if you find a vulnerability with http4k code. Typically you can expect a response the same working day. 

For vulnerabilities in third party dependencies, we monitor these separately and update as soon as a fix is released by the maintainers.
Our normal policy is to fix-forward.
